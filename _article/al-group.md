## Group 

A set $S$ equipped with a binary operation $S\times S \rightarrow S$, which satisfies the following three axioms:

* <strong>Associativity </strong>: For all $a,b$ and $c$ in $S$, the equation $(a\cdot, b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ holds
* <strong>Identity Element </strong> : There exists an element $e$ in $S$ such that $e\cdot a = a \cdot e = a $ holds for all $a\in S$. 
* <strong>Inverse Element </strong> : There exists an unique element $b$ in $S$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a  = e $ holds for all $a\in S$. 


## Semigroup 

A set $S$ equipped with a binary operation $S\times S \rightarrow S$, which satisfies the following axiom:

* <strong>Associativity </strong>: For all $a,b$ and $c$ in $S$, the equation $(a\cdot, b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ holds

## Monoid 

Monoid is a semigroup with identity element. 

A set $S$ equipped with a binary operation $S\times S \rightarrow S$, which satisfies the following two axioms:

* <strong>Associativity </strong>: For all $a,b$ and $c$ in $S$, the equation $(a\cdot, b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ holds
* <strong>Identity Element </strong> : There exists an element $e$ in $S$ such that $e\cdot a = a \cdot e = a $ holds for all $a\in S$.
