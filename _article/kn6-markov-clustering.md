## Algorithm 

1. Expansion
2. Inflation 
3. Until a crietria meets



## Expansion 

$$
M \leftarrow M^p
$$

## Inflation 

Given a matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{k\times l}, M \ge 0$ and a real nonnegative number $r$. 
Inflation operation $\Gamma_r$ is defined by 

$$
(\Gamma_r M)_{pg} = (M_{pq})^r / \sum_{t=1}^k (M_{tq})^r
$$


## Crietria
