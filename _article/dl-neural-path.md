Khakzar et al proposed a pathway selection via neurons's contribution to the response. 

The authors demonstrate that sparse pathways derived from pruning do not necessarily encode critical input information. To ensure sparse pathways include critical fragments of the encoded input information, we propose pathway selection via neurons’ contribution to the response.

The pruning objective — selecting the smallest group of neurons for which the response remains equivalent to the original network
