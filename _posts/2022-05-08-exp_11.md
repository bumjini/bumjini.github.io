# 1. Motivation 

Layer-wise Relevance Propagation is widely used to explain the decision of models. LRP shows the contribution of prediction for all pixels. 

In this experiment, we measured the LRP score for bounding box in an image. 

We also discuss about the size of bouding box for IMAGE-NET classes. 

The result show that there is increasing trend for LRP scores in the bounding box even though it is normalized by the region size. 


# 2. Method 

The relative Layse-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is measured by 

$$
\Large{\mu = \frac{|P_{in}|^{-1} \sum_{p \in O_{\text{in}}} R_p}{|P_{out}|^{-1} \sum_{p \in O_{\text{out}}} R_p}}
$$

<p>
It measures the ratio between in and out of the object region. If this value is large, the scores are centered in the object region and in the other case, the more scores are in the out of the object region. Figure 1 shows an example of an object region.
