# 1. Motivaiton of this expeirment

Understanding the decision of deep neural networks is important but requires massive amount of information. There was a research explaining the decision by clustering relevance scores of LRP scores. However, there is little discussion on how to cluster them appropriately. Thereofre, we shows the results of different kinds of building the graph structure of LRP scores. In detail, we present the clustering results with CIFAR 10 dataset by 1) different ways of making a weighted adjacency matrix and 2) different ways of normalizing the laplace matrix. 



## 2. Categories. 

### 2.1 similarity matrix to weighted adjacency matrix 


We make a similiarity matrix of LRP score $R_{p_i}$ and $R_{p_j}$ by  $S = (s_{ij})}$ where $s_{ij} = -\exp{\frac{\| R_{p_i} - R_{p_j}  \|}{\sigma^2}}$.
We used the class **ship**. 


* **$\epsilon$-neighborhood** 

We set $\epsilon$ as the standard deviation of $S$

* **$k$-nearest neighborhood**

We set $k= \log{N_c}$ as the nubmer of clusters when $N_c$ is the number of class of interest. 

$$
w_{ij} = \begin{cases}
s_{ij} & if R_i and R_j both in the cluster of each other \\
0 & otherwise\\
\end{cases}
$$

* **mutual $k$-nearest neighborhood**

$$
w_{ij} = \begin{cases}
s_{ij} & if R_i or R_i are in the cluster of each otehr\\
0 & otherwise \\
\end{cases}
$$

* **full-graph**

$$
w_{ij} = s_{ij}
$$


### 2.2 normalizing vs unnormalizing


* **unnormalized Laplace matrix**

L = D - W 

where $D_i = \sum_j w_{ij}$

* **Normalized Laplace matrix $L_{sym}$**


$$ 
L_{rw} = D^{-1/2} L D^{-1/2}
$$

* **Normalized Laplace matrix $L_{rw}$**


$$ 
L_{rw} = D^{-1} L
$$
