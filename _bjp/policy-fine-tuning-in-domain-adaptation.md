description: 'What happens in neurons when we fine-tune a RL policy to adapt?'

## Introduction 

This paper investigate the behavior of domain-adaption neurons in RL. 

We also propose a method to make the training stable while training so that we can get better domain adaptation results with interpretable behaviors. 


## Related Work

### Domain Adaptation 

### Neuron In RL 



We leverage the two stage reinforcement learning where an agent has a domain-generalized policy and then, fine-tune the policy to a new environment. 
This work track the behavior of neurons while training.
