This blog is started by an idea that the fastest way to learn something is taking experiments. `Creative Rudiment` is a personal blog for experiments on various domains including `Reinforcement Learning`, `Vision`, `NLP` and `XAI`. 

You can check a list of experiments in [🔖Rudiment](/blog/). 
The experiments are done by myself. 
If you have any idea or comments on the experiment, contact `bjp032501@gmail.com`.
