I belive it is the fastest way to learn something by taking an experiment. `Creative Rudiment` is a personal blog for experiments on various domains including `Reinforcement Learning`, `Vision`, `NLP` and `XAI`.
Deep neural network is nothing but a complex function and can be undestood only by a lot of experiments. 
You can check a list of experiments in [experiment](/blog/) and well documneted knowledges in [knowledge](/knowledge/).
